Constantly updated lists of world countries, territories and areas of geographical interest, with associated *alpha-2*, *alpha-3* and *numeric codes* as defined by the *ISO 3166-1* standard, published and maintained by the [International Organization for Standardization](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html), available in `CSV`, `JSON` and `SQL` formats, in multiple languages and with national flags included.

In the language folders you will find files named in two different ways. Here's what you will find in each of them:

|File names | Content |
|:---:|:---
| <a name="world"></a>*world.** | Files named like this contain all the **249** countries, territories, and areas of geographical interest that have an officially assigned *ISO 3166-1* code.
| <a name="countries"></a>*countries.** | Files named like this contain **195** entries made up from the 193 sovereign states (commonly refered to as *countries*) that are members of the [United&nbsp;Nations (UN)](http://www.un.org/en/member-states/index.html) plus the 2 [observer states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_observers) of *Palestine* and the *Vatican City State*.

> Note that there are 206 sovereign states in the world, the 11 states that are missing from the *countries* list being the ones having their sovereignty disputed. See the list of [sovereign states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states) with information on their status and recognition of their sovereignty.

- the **ISO 3166-1 numeric** country codes
- the **ISO 3166** official short names in *English*<small><sup>[1](#footnote)</sup></small>
- the **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2** two-letter country codes
- the **ISO 3166-1 alpha-3** three-letter country codes

You probably don't want to download the lists in all languages so go ahead and [download your customized build](http://stefangabos.github.io/world_countries/).

The package also contains the national flags of each country as a 16x16, 24x24, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64 and 128x128 PNG images, courtesy of [IconDrawer](http://icondrawer.com/free.php). The image files are named using the ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code of the country they represent, for easily pairing flags with countries.

Country names in all languages are taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1).
